All images/pngs are tarot cards from the Rider-Waite tarot deck, also known as the Ride-Waite-Smith deck.

These files are of 1909 cards scanned by Holly Voley (http://home.comcast.net/~vilex/) for the public domain,
and retrieved from http://www.sacred-texts.com/tarot (see note on that page regarding source of all the
images in thie folder).

Published in 1909.

Copyright holder was Arthur Edward Waite.

Pamela Coleman Smith did an artist's "work for hire" for Waite; she was paid for her work, but never did she
hold the copyright to the drawings or their descriptions.

Currently, as of 2014, no longer under copyright in the US (and arguably not in the UK either).

All images/pngs are tarot cards from the Rider-Waite tarot deck, also known as the Ride-Waite-Smith deck.

These files are of 1909 cards scanned by Holly Voley (http://home.comcast.net/~vilex/) for the public domain,
and retrieved from http://www.sacred-texts.com/tarot (see note on that page regarding source of all the
images in thie folder).

Published in 1909.

Copyright holder was Arthur Edward Waite.

Pamela Coleman Smith did an artist's "work for hire" for Waite; she was paid for her work, but never did she
hold the copyright to the drawings or their descriptions.

Currently, as of 2014, no longer under copyright in the US (and arguably not in the UK either).


These are NOT the modified and recoloured US Games version published in 1971 (which are still under copyright).


So these images fall into the public domain in the United States because they were first published outside the
United States prior to January 1st, 1923.  Other jurisdictions have other rules.  Also note that these images
may not be in the public domain in the 9th Circuit if it was published on or after July 1st, 1909 noncompliant
with United States formalities, unles the author is known to have died in 1943 or earlier (more than 70 years
ago) or the work was created in 1893 or earlier (more than 120 yeaers ago).
